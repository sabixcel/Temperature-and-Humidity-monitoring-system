# Temperature-and-Humidity-monitoring-system

Using an Arduino development board, and some electronic components, this project presents an electrical circuit to measure the temperature and humidity in the room.
The most important component is the temperature and humidity sensor: DHT11, which has an operating voltage between 3.5V and 5.5V, a temperature range of 0°C to 50°C and humidity range of 20% to 90% with an accuracy of ±1°C and ±1%.
The components required for implementing the project are: Arduino Uno R3 board, DHT11 Temperature&Humidity Sensor(4 pins), Jumper Wires, 10kΩ Resistor, Breadboard(generic), an LCD and an Arduino USB 2.0 Cable.
